Let me note the logic behind the execution of every command

MSG
 server checks
	are there at least two parameters?
	does the first parameter correspond to the nickname of a user in the channel?
	does the second parameter have at least one char?

JOIN
 server checks 
 	is there at least one parameter
	does the parameter start with # 
	does the parameter have any other alphanum?
	does the alphanum match with an existing channel from the list?
	if yes then join (do we need a password?)
	 if client isn't already member of the channel 
	   add the client nickname to the set of users in the channel 
	if no then create channel 
	add client to channel
