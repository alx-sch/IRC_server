Let me note the logic behind the execution of irc commands - pavlos


ALL check for the minimum required parameters


USER (4 params)
	this is a command used internally (I think) to establish the identity of the user 
	<username> <hostname> <servername> <realname>

	check if all 4 parameters are present 
	is user already registered? 
		yes -> some kind of error
		no -> set user identity info 

KICK
are there at least two parameters?

	does the first parameter correspond to an active channel?
	server checks if sender is operator 
	does the second parameter correspond to the nickname of a user in the channel?
	server removes user from channel 
	
 
INVITE


TOPIC (min. 1 parameter)
	this can be used both for viewing the topic and changing it 
	<channel> [<topic>]
	does the channel exist 
	is the sender a member 
	if the second parameter is defined AND topic protection is enable 
		- is sended the channel operator?


 
 Command: MODE
  `Parameters: <channel> {[+|-]|o|p|s|i|t|n|b|v} [<limit>] [<user>]`
               `[<ban mask>]`
OR
` Parameters: <nickname> {[+|-]|i|w|s|o}`

LIST
 [<channel>{,<channel>}][<server>] -- note the parameters here are optional
 for every channel in channel parameters that exists 
	return channel 
for every server in server parameters that is valid 
	return server 
	


MSG
 <target> <text>
 server checks
	are there at least two parameters?
	does the first parameter correspond to the nickname of a user in the channel?
	does the second parameter have at least one char?

JOIN
 server checks 
 	is there at least one parameter
	does the parameter start with # 
	does the parameter have any other alphanum?
	does the alphanum match with an existing channel from the list?
	if yes then join (do we need a password?)
	 if client isn't already member of the channel 
	   add the client nickname to the set of users in the channel 
	if no then create channel 
	add client to channel


PART
   Parameters: <channel>{,<channel>}
   The PART message causes the client sending the message to be removed
   from the list of active users for all given channels listed in the
   parameter string.

   Numeric Replies:

           ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS              ERR_NOSUCHCHANNEL
           ERR_NOTONCHANNEL

OPER

   OPER message is used by a normal user to obtain operator privileges.
   The combination of <user> and <password> are required to gain
   Operator privileges.

*the hopcount is weird and I don't fully get it*
